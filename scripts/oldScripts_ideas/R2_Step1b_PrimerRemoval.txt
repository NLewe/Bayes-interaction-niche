## Primer removal with cutadapt ###

# After demultiplexing of the raw sequence libraries with cutadapt, which removed the barcode sequences as well, 
# the primer sequences need to be removed as well
# A linux environment (bash) with cutadapt installed is again needed for that step.

# First a new directory is made, for example "Lib01_primer_removed"

mkdir Lib01_primer-removed

# The command to remove all primer sequences from all files in a folder is:
# The resulting files will be added to the new directory Lib01_primer-removed

### Notes:
-g is the anchored forward (FWD) primer
-a is the complementary inverse reverse primer.
-G is the anchored reverse (REV) primer
-A is the complementary inverse forward primer
