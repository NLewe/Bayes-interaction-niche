####   RUN STEPS IN A LINUX TERMINAL (BASH SCRIPT) ########

## Preparation - installation :

https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
## install cutadapt - it needs a Linux environment. 
# on windows, I used Ubuntu (linux environment) on WSL2 (windows subsystem) to run cutadapt 
# All demultiplexing was done on the High Performance Computing system "Rapoi" of Victoria University of Wellington (New Zealand).


## Primer removal with cutadapt ###

# After demultiplexing of the raw sequence libraries with cutadapt, which removed the barcode sequences whilst demultiplexing,  
# the primer sequences need to be removed as well
# A linux environment (bash) with cutadapt installed is again needed for that step.

# First a new directory is made, for example "Lib_primer_removed"

mkdir Lib_primer_removed


# The resulting files will be added to the new directory Lib_primer_removed in the next step
# The command to remove all primer sequences from all downloaded fastq files in a folder is:

for i in *.R1.fastq.gz
do
SAMPLE=$(echo ${i} | sed "s/.R1\.fastq\.gz//") 
echo ${SAMPLE}.R1.fastq.gz ${SAMPLE}.R2.fastq.gz 
cutadapt -m 1 -e 0.12 \
-g "CAHCGATGAAGAACGYRG;min_overlap=6"  -a "GCATATCAATAAGCGSAGGA;min_overlap=6" \
-G "TCCTSCGCTTATTGATATGC;min_overlap=6"  -A "CYRCGTTCTTCATCGDTG;min_overlap=6"  \
-o Lib_primer_removed/${SAMPLE}.R1.fastq.gz \
-p Lib_primer_removed/${SAMPLE}.R2.fastq.gz  ${SAMPLE}.R1.fastq.gz ${SAMPLE}.R2.fastq.gz \
>> primer_summ.txt
done

# Because some of the files have a slightly different naming structure, run also:

for i in *_R1.fastq.gz
do
SAMPLE=$(echo ${i} | sed "s/_R1\.fastq\.gz//") 
echo ${SAMPLE}_R1.fastq.gz ${SAMPLE}_R2.fastq.gz 
cutadapt -m 1 -e 0.12 \
-g "CAHCGATGAAGAACGYRG;min_overlap=6"  -a "GCATATCAATAAGCGSAGGA;min_overlap=6" \
-G "TCCTSCGCTTATTGATATGC;min_overlap=6"  -A "CYRCGTTCTTCATCGDTG;min_overlap=6"  \
-o Lib_primer_removed/${SAMPLE}.R1.fastq.gz \
-p Lib_primer_removed/${SAMPLE}.R2.fastq.gz  ${SAMPLE}_R1.fastq.gz ${SAMPLE}_R2.fastq.gz \
>> primer_summ.txt
done

### Notes:
#  -g is the anchored forward (FWD) primer
#  -a is the complementary inverse reverse primer.
#  -G is the anchored reverse (REV) primer
#  -A is the complementary inverse forward primer

## Explanations on the use of cutadapt can be found in

# The authors humbly thank the cutadapt developer Marcel Martin https://github.com/marcelm for their amazing work and their thorough manual. 


## Note that the fastq files of this project originate from different experiments. 
## All following steps should be run separately on the files from each experiment ##
